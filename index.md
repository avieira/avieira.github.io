## About me

I am currently (since January 2020) a postdoctoral researcher in the [PIMENT](https://piment.univ-reunion.fr/) lab and working in the UPPA (Universit√© de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour), under the supervision of Dr. Pierre-Henri Cocquet.

I worked as a research engineer in [Pollen Metrology](https://pollen-metrology.com/), in a collaboration with Grenoble Alpes University. My academic advisor was [Christophe Picard](http://membres-ljk.imag.fr/picard/). 

Before that, I was part of the [Tripop](https://team.inria.fr/tripop/) team as a PhD Student, under the supervision of [Bernard Brogliato](http://www.inrialpes.fr/bipop/people/brogliato/) and [Christophe Prieur](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~christophe.prieur). I defended on Sep. 25 2018.

You can find my complete CV (in french) [here](../pdf/CVAlexandreVieira.pdf).
