## About me

I am currently (since October 2024) a postdoctoral researcher in the [ACUMES](https://team.inria.fr/acumes/) team at [Inria Côte d'Azur](https://www.inria.fr/en/inria-centre-universite-cote-azur), working with Dr Laurent Monasse, in a joint collaboration with [Altair](https://altairengineering.fr/).

Before that, I've been a postdoctoral researcher in the [LJAD](https://math.unice.fr/) lab, [fluid mechanics](https://math.unice.fr/laboratoire/equipes-de-recherche/mod%c3%a9lisation-num%c3%a9rique-et-dynamique-des-fluides.html) team between October 2022 and September 2024. I am working under the supervision of Dr Florence Marcotte, Pr Dider Auroux and Pr Hervé Guillard.

I've been between January 2020 and May 2022 a postdoctoral researcher in the [PIMENT](https://piment.univ-reunion.fr/) lab and working in the UPPA (Université de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour), under the supervision of Dr. Pierre-Henri Cocquet.

I worked as a research engineer in [Pollen Metrology](https://pollen-metrology.com/), in a collaboration with Grenoble Alpes University. My academic advisor was [Christophe Picard](http://membres-ljk.imag.fr/picard/). 

Before that, I was part of the [Tripop](https://team.inria.fr/tripop/) team as a PhD Student, under the supervision of [Bernard Brogliato](http://www.inrialpes.fr/bipop/people/brogliato/) and [Christophe Prieur](http://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~christophe.prieur). I defended on Sep. 25 2018.
